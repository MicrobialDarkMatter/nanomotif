Welcome to Nanomotif's documentation!
===================================

**Nanomotif** is a Python package designed to explore methylation in prokaryotic genomes
using Nanopore sequencing. Nanomotif is a fast, scalable, and sensitive tool for identification and utilization 
of methylation motifs in monocultures and metagenomic samples. Nanomotif offers de novo methylated motif identification, 
metagenomic bin contamination detection, bin association of unbinned contigs, and linking of MTase genes to methylation motifs.
