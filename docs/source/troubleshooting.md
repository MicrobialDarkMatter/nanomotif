# Troubleshooting


If you encounter any issues running Nanomotif or preparing input files, that are not listed below, feel free to open an issue on github. 

## Polars versions (For Nanomotif versions <0.7.0)

We have experienced issues regarding `polars` versions. Nanomotif was developed using polars 0.19.x, and many of the functions used in the code are not available in the latest version of polars. We recommend using polars 0.19.x for running Nanomotif. Specifically, `polars` version 0.20.17 and up.
